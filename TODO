enhancements:
-------------
vi-style keybindings
	{{ normal mode }}
	* 'x' only deletes notes in track tab.. it needs to delete any one thing in
		any tab
	* 'X' to clear a whole line in any tab
	* we need to be able to select the octave and note seperately in track tab,
		so we can change them seperately with 'J' and 'K'
	* implement jammermode:
		q2w3er5t6y7u will all play notes.
		other bindings that can stay: hjkl, ^h, ^l, ^j, ^k
	* make comand mode
	* Number+action, do that action that many times
	* record mode?

bugs:
----
right now there are at least 7 states for the mode to be in, lol. this is too many. agreed --tony.
	problem solved by adding a new mode, lol -- jammermode

octave goes to 20 when using J and K in tracktab

all sounds should be stopped when pressing play again, otherwise some
	instruments can hang...

J and K on low digit of params isn't recognized
