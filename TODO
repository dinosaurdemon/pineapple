enhancements:
-------------
vi-style keybindings
	* 'x' and 'X' only work in instr tab
	* we need to be able to select the octave and note seperately in track tab,
		so we can change them seperately with 'J' and 'K'
	* implement jammermode:
		q2w3er5t6y7u will all play notes, without inserting them
		other bindings that can stay: hjkl, ^h, ^l, ^j, ^k
	* make comand mode
	* record mode?

control with a gamepad

save as.. support

port gui to libcaca.
branch?

tempo control

bugs:
----
right now there are at least 7 states for the mode to be in, lol. this is too many. agreed --tony.
	problem solved by adding a new mode, lol -- jammermode

J and K on low digit of params isn't recognized

pressing 'd' stops the screen from updating (noticeable while playing)
