enhancements:
-------------
vi-style keybindings
	* we need to be able to select the octave and note seperately in track tab,
		so we can change them seperately with 'J' and 'K'
		-- this isn't so essential now that there is H and L to alter notes by
		octave
	* implement jammermode: q2w3er5t6y7u will all play notes, without inserting them
		other bindings that can stay: hjkl, ^h, ^l, ^j, ^k
	* make comand mode
		* ':num' - go to line number num
	* record mode?
	* visual mode for copy/paste like in lgpt
	* u - undo
	* document the keys

* control with a gamepad

* save as.. support

* port gui to libcaca.
branch?

* tempo control

bugs:
----
* pressing 'd' stops the screen from updating (noticeable while playing)

* sound doesn't always stop after pressing space. e.g. try a track with
	intrument 3 in pumpkinale and stop playback.

* when switching to + or = in instrument view, the note is sometimes out of
	range if the params are high.

* copy (yy) and paste (p) isn't working

* instrx is incremented when exiting from insert mode in the last line of
	instr view, putting the cursor on the first line.

dreams:
------
config files
rainbow decibel meters on each track like AHX tracker
