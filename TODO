enhancements:
-------------
vi-style keybindings
	* 'x' and 'X' only work in instr tab
	* we need to be able to select the octave and note seperately in track tab,
		so we can change them seperately with 'J' and 'K'
	* implement jammermode: q2w3er5t6y7u will all play notes, without inserting them
		other bindings that can stay: hjkl, ^h, ^l, ^j, ^k
	* make comand mode
		* ':num' - go to line number num
	* record mode?
	* visual mode for copy/paste like in lgpt
	* u - undo

control with a gamepad

save as.. support

port gui to libcaca.
branch?

tempo control

bugs:
----
pressing 'd' stops the screen from updating (noticeable while playing)

dreams:
------
config files
rainbow decibel meters on each track like AHX tracker
