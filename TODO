enhancements:
-------------
vi-style keybindings
	{{ normal mode }}
	* 'x' only deletes notes in track tab.. it needs to delete any one thing in
		any tab
	* 'X' to clear a whole line in any tab
	* we need to be able to select the octave and note seperately in track tab,
		so we can change them seperately with 'J' and 'K'
	* implement jammermode:
		q2w3er5t6y7u will all play notes.
		other bindings that can stay: hjkl, ^h, ^l, ^j, ^k
	* make comand mode
	* Number+action, do that action that many times
	* record mode?

i think every action should be called with the function actexec(), that way
	we can have all the actual code for the action there and we don't have to
	keep multiple copies of the same function in multiple modes. hey maybe
	every action should be a function? *_* i dunno

control with a gamepad

show play position in instrument view

save as.. support

port gui to libcaca.
branch?

bugs:
----
right now there are at least 7 states for the mode to be in, lol. this is too many. agreed --tony.
	problem solved by adding a new mode, lol -- jammermode
