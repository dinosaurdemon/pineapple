enhancements:
-------------
vi-style keybindings
	* 'x' and 'X' only work in instr tab
	* we need to be able to select the octave and note seperately in track tab,
		so we can change them seperately with 'J' and 'K'
	* implement jammermode: q2w3er5t6y7u will all play notes, without inserting them
		other bindings that can stay: hjkl, ^h, ^l, ^j, ^k
	* make comand mode
		* ':num' - go to line number num
	* record mode?
	* visual mode for copy/paste like in lgpt
	* u - undo
	* document the keys

* control with a gamepad

* save as.. support

* port gui to libcaca.
branch?

* tempo control

bugs:
----
* pressing 'd' stops the screen from updating (noticeable while playing)

* '.' sometimes doesn't work correctly if you move then use it in the new
	place. This is because '.' calls the last action executed, which
	doesn't necessarily coincide with what keycommand was pressed. I need to
	fix all the ACT_* functions so they each represent a key combo. Actually,
	this is what handleinput() already does, so I turned a lot of that into
	executekey and I'll mess with it pretty soon.

* get warnings like this when compiling on x86_64:
	gui.c:1016: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size

dreams:
------
config files
rainbow decibel meters on each track like AHX tracker
